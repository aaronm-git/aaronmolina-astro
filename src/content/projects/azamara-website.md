Led the redesign and development of the entire Azamara Cruises website, building reusable React components and integrating GraphQL APIs with AWS AppSync. Reduced deployment times by 40% through reusable components and worked closely with designers using Figma for UI/UX. The site now reflects Azamara’s premium cruise branding with modern performance standards.
