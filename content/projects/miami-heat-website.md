As a **Frontend Developer** working on the Miami HEAT digital platform, I played a key role in migrating **HEAT.com**, **KaseyaCenter.com**, and **HeatCheck.nba.com** to a modern, mobile-first stack.

The goal was to give fans a faster, smoother, and more responsive experience‚Äîespecially on mobile. I collaborated with a small team of engineers, designers, and content managers to bring the new platform to life ahead of the 2022 NBA Playoffs.

### üß± Tech Overview

We moved the frontend to a lightweight, performance-focused stack built with **React**, **Bootstrap**, and a custom WordPress/Drupal integration on the backend. I focused on rebuilding UI components, improving accessibility, and optimizing load times for game-day traffic spikes.

- Rebuilt key page layouts including player profiles, game previews, and playoff banners
- Applied mobile-first design principles to improve the UX across devices
- Cleaned up legacy CSS and implemented consistent design tokens and spacing systems
- Integrated REST APIs for pulling live stats, scores, and schedule updates

### üìä Results

- **Fan engagement** increased by 30% after the redesign
- **Mobile traffic** went up by 50% due to better responsiveness and speed
- **Site load time** improved by 40%, especially on mobile and slower connections
- **Merchandise conversions** rose 20% thanks to better mobile checkout UX
- During the **2022 Playoffs**, we handled a 25% spike in traffic with zero downtime

### üé® Component Improvements

One area I focused on was building reusable components for things like:

- Game schedule listings
- Ticket modals
- Team stats widgets
- Video highlights

These were designed to be dropped into any page without custom logic, making the marketing team more agile in launching campaigns.

### üìå What I Took Away

This was one of the first high-visibility NBA projects I worked on. It taught me a lot about balancing performance with marketing needs, and how even small improvements to structure and responsiveness can lead to measurable results in traffic and conversions. I also got to see firsthand how frontend work supports a brand‚Äôs identity during peak moments like playoff season.
