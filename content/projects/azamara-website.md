As **Lead Frontend Developer** at Azamara Cruises, I rebuilt Azamara.com from the ground up. The site was running on old Royal Caribbean systems that were slow and hard to maintain. We needed something modern that could handle the luxury cruise brand's needs.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview

- Built the frontend with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, and **Bootstrap** for consistent, modular UI
- Connected **GraphQL APIs through AWS AppSync** for fast, dynamic content delivery
- Built custom components in **CrafterCMS** so non-technical users could create pages without developer help
- Wrote Python scripts to automate cruise data imports from multiple sources
- Maintained and extended Seaware GraphQL APIs for cruise inventory and product updates

### üí° Senior-Level Contributions

- Cut deployment time by **over 40%** with reusable components and better CMS workflows
- Worked as the **technical bridge** between design, content, and eCommerce teams to keep cruise itineraries accurate and campaigns on schedule
- Ran **accessibility**, **performance**, and **SEO audits** to ensure a polished experience for luxury travelers worldwide
- Handled critical product launches (like World Cruises) with **99.9% uptime**
- Managed version control, QA, and release processes for the frontend

### üìà Business & Brand Impact

- Upgraded Azamara's brand identity with a consistent, luxurious, and fast frontend
- Gave marketing and content teams a scalable system (CrafterCMS) they could use independently
- Enabled faster cruise announcements and promotions that aligned with eCommerce goals
- Successfully separated from Royal Caribbean's technical infrastructure

This project shows my ability to **lead frontend transformations** while delivering real business value through performance, reliability, and user empowerment.
