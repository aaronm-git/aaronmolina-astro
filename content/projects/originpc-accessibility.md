As a **Senior Frontend Developer** working with CORSAIR’s OriginPC division, I led the accessibility overhaul for their eCommerce platform. My goal was to make the site work better for everyone, including users who rely on assistive tech like screen readers.

### 🛠️ Technical Breakdown

**Scope:** Full WCAG 2.1 AA audit and remediation for OriginPC.com, focusing on product and checkout flows.

**Tech stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ARIA, Axe DevTools, Chrome Lighthouse

- Audited and fixed keyboard traps, missing ARIA roles, poor contrast, unlabeled fields, and non-semantic markup
- Wrote clear, developer-friendly audit reports with step-by-step remediations and QA steps
- Refactored core components for better screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- Used semantic HTML and built reusable patterns for accessible buttons, menus, and forms
- Worked closely with UX and QA teams to test fixes on real screen reader devices (JAWS, NVDA)
- Ran training sessions and async code reviews to help the team build accessibility habits

### 💡 Senior-Level Contributions

This project was about more than just fixing code. I focused on building a culture of accessibility:

- Created an internal accessibility checklist for future component development
- Added automated a11y testing to the CI pipeline with Lighthouse and Axe CLI
- Helped project managers understand the legal and brand risks of ignoring accessibility
- Worked with CORSAIR’s legal team to document the project’s scope and results

### ✅ Outcomes & Impact

- Brought the site up to **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance across all public pages
- Lowered legal risk and improved CORSAIR’s reputation for inclusivity
- Made the site easier to use for everyone, including keyboard-only and low-bandwidth users
- Gave the CORSAIR team the tools and knowledge to keep things accessible without needing outside audits

> 💬 “Making the web more accessible isn't just good engineering. It's responsible, scalable design. I helped CORSAIR build that mindset into their product team.”
